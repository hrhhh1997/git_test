The 3 main parts of git are the WORKING DIRECTORY, the STAGING AREA, and  the REPOSITORY.
When working on a file in the directory, the file is presented at the 'working directory' stage. After the work is done, the user enters the command <git add 
[filename.extension]> to add the file to the staging area. Alternatively, the command <git add .> can be used in order to add all(.) files to the staging area. The 
staging area is like the waiting room for files and directories that are waiting to be committed before being sent to the repository. To move the files and/or 
directories from the staging area to the next stage to be committed, the command <git commit -m "the message"> is used. The '-m' option is what allows the user to 
include a message in the commit. After the commit is done, in order to upload the work to the repository, the command <git push OR git push origin main> is used to push 
the file/directory to the repository.

<git status> allows us to view the status of our git works at all times.

<git log> allows us view the logs of operations that have been done using git.

<git clone "ssh key"> allows us to clone an online repository to our machine.
